## 🌐 Project Overview

SmartFarm Pro revolutionizes agricultural irrigation through IoT and AI-driven automation. This system intelligently manages water resources by:

- Continuously monitoring soil conditions (moisture, pH, temperature)
- Analyzing weather forecasts and evapotranspiration rates
- Automating precise water delivery through smart valves
- Providing real-time analytics via web/mobile interfaces

## ✨ Key Features

### 🌦️ Environmental Adaptation
- Real-time weather integration (OpenWeatherMap API)
- Predictive watering algorithms
- Frost/heatwave protection modes

### 📊 Advanced Analytics
```python
# Sample analytics pseudocode
def calculate_water_need(soil_moisture, weather_data):
    evapotranspiration = calculate_ET(weather_data)
    water_deficit = optimal_moisture - soil_moisture
    return max(0, water_deficit + 0.2 * evapotranspiration)
```

### 🔌 Hardware Components
| Component | Specification | Purpose |
|-----------|--------------|---------|
| Soil Probe | Capacitive Moisture Sensor | Accurate root-zone monitoring |
| Gateway | ESP32 with LoRa | Long-range communication |
| Valves | 12V Solenoid | Precise zone control |

## 🏗️ System Architecture

### Three-Tier Design:
1. **Edge Layer**: Sensors and actuators
2. **Fog Layer**: Local gateway for preprocessing
3. **Cloud Layer**: Data storage and analytics
